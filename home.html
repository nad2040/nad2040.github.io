    <p>Hi. I'm Dan.</p>
    <p>I love learning things from watching Youtube videos and reading random articles.</p>
    <p>This website's head and body elements are lazy loaded with HTMX. I think it's a pretty cool way to do web programming.</p>
    <p>More updates soon™ (maybe)</p>
    <p>better CSS soon™ (never)</p>
