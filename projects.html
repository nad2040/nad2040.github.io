    A lot of random small and fun projects really. I count projects as any work I did that gave me a learning experience. <br><br>
    Web Server in C<br>
    Multithreaded Server and Client<br>
    Scheme Interpreter in C++<br>
    Arithmetic Expression Calculator in C++<br><br>
    I learned some Reinforcement Learning in the summer of 2023, which isn't a project per se, but it took effort and I learned a lot, so I count it as one. :)<br>
    My work for Professor Greenberg on pack/unpack is also really a project. I learned Rust while working on it.<br><br>
    Overall, I learned a lot by doing these projects. And I'd love to learn more.<br><br>
    I've started my langparser project in Rust, but haven't decided on what kind of grammar I want my language to have, which is pretty important, oops :P<br>
